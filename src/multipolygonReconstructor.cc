/* The high-level algorithm to create multipolygons from a multipolygon relation is as follows:
 *     1. ignore all non-way members
 *     2. build geometric rings (node sequences that start and end with the same node) by
 *        connecting ways
 *     3. from all rings build a geometric "contains" hierarchy (each ring becomes the child
 *        node to that ring which directly contains it)
 *     4. from the "contains" hierarchy, assign inner/outer roles to form the multipolygon (not
 *        yet implemented)
 *     5. import tags from outer ways if necessary
 *
 *  Details:
 *  ========
 *
 *  2. Building Geometric Rings:
 *  ------------------
 *  Basic idea: Repeatedly find ways that share at least one endpoint, and connect those ways 
 *              until none are left. Then, discard any connected ways that do not start and
 *              end at the same point. Those are not closed and thus represent invalid parts 
 *              of a multipolygon geometry. The remaining ways are the rings.
 *
 *  Implementation details:
 *  - In order to connect two ways, one way may need to be reversed to fit. In extreme cases, 
 *    ways have to be reversed for each connecting of two ways. This could potentially impact 
 *    performance negatively. 
 *    This implementation instead first creates an abstract RingSegment representation for each 
 *    way, containing only its two end points, a reference to the wayId, and a boolean 'reversed'
 *    flag storing whether a way needs to be reversed before connecting it (but without actually
 *    performing the reversion). The finding and 'connecting' of ways is then performed only on
 *    the RingSegments: Whenever two RingSegments should be connected, a new RingSegment is 
 *    created that contains both original segments as its childred, and contains the open end 
 *    points of its children (i.e. those that are not connected to each other). The 'reversed' 
 *    flag of the children is set accordingly. From that point on, the two original RingSegments
 *    are no longer considered for connection to other segments, but only the newly created one is. 
 *    This effectively creates a binary tree of RingSegments for each ring, where the end points
 *    of the top-most RingSegment are identical (if the hierarchy indeed represents a closed
 *    ring). Once built, this hierarchy is then flattened into the actual ring by traversing it
 *    in-order, and adding the nodes of all ways referenced by traversed RingSegments to the 
 *    output (along with the list of wayIds - for later algorithms that might need that list).
 *    In this process, each way is reversed *at most once*.
 *
 *  - Finding pairs of ways that can be connected would be ineffective if implemented naively
 *    (testing each way against every other way). Instead, we use a dictionary to map open (i.e.
 *    unconnected) endpoints to the corresponding RingSegment and test for connectable
 *    RingSegments by checking whether a way's endpoint is present in that dictionary.
 *    In detail, the dictionary is initially empty, and RingSegments are added to it
 *    incrementally: Each RingSegment is only added to the dictionary, if none of its endpoints
 *    is already in there. Otherwise, the RingSegment belonging to that endpoint is removed from
 *    the dictionary (i.e. both of its endpoints are removed), a new merged RingSegment is
 *    created covering the two segments, and only the new RingSegment is re-considered for 
 *    insertion into the dictionary. Any RingSegment that is closed in itself is never added to
 *    the dictionary, but is directly stored in a list of closed rings. If the set of all rings
 *    form a valid multipolygon, the list of open endpoints will be empty, as all rings have
 *    been closed. Otherwise (for invalid geometry), the set of open rings is discarded. 
 *    This approach should only need O(n log(n) ) time (adding at most O(n) RingSegments to the
 *    dictionary, with each insertion requiring O(log(n)) time) in the number of RingSegments,
 *    while the naive approach requires O(nÂ²) time (testing every way against every other way).
 *
 *
 *    3. Building the 'Contains' Hierarchy
 *    ====================================
 *    Multipolygons consist of 'outer' Rings, and 'holes' inside these Rings. In theory, all OSM
 *    multipolygon members are correctly tagged with the corresponding 'outer' and 'inner'
 *    roles. In practice, however, role tagging can be wrong, inconsistent or missing, and the
 *    geometry itself may be inconsistent (e.g. an 'outer' ring overlapping with an 'inner'
 *    ring). Thus, to guarantee creation of valid multipolygons, role tagging must be ignored.
 *    Instead, geometric inconsistencies must be healed, and the correct roles be reconstructed
 *    geometrically.
 *    To that end, a 'contains' hierarchy of rings is created, where each ring can have any
 *    number of other rings as children, and a ring A is a direct parent of another ring B iff.
 *    A contains B and there is no other ring C which is contained in A and in turn contains B.
 *    From that hierarchy, the outer/inner roles can easily be determined: any ring on the top
 *    level is an 'outer' ring. Any ring on the next level is an 'inner' ring (a hole in an
 *    'outer' ring). Then, the roles 'outer' and 'inner' alternate for each further level
 *    (e.g. all rings on the third level are 'outer' rings, representing a polygon inside a 
 *    hole of another polygon).
 *    
 *    To build this hierarchy efficiently, it is observed that a ring A can only contain another
 *    ring B, if the area of A is bigger than that of B. Thus, all rings are sorted by area in
 *    descending order, and are inserted into the hierarchy one by one in that order. So, no
 *    ring can contain any ring inserted into the hierarchy beforeitself, and it is thus
 *    guaranteed that once inserted the position of a ring inside the hierarchy never has to
 *    change.
 *
 *    In detail, a ring is inserted into the hierarchy as follows. Each ring is inserted
 *    recursively, starting with the top level (the list of all top-level rings not contained in
 *    any other ring.): at each level the ring under consideration may be:
 *    - not overlapping with any other ring at that level. In that case it is inserted into 
 *      the hierarchy at that level.
 *    - overlap with another ring at that level (i.e. there is some geometry shared by both
 *      rings, and some geometry exclusive to either ring). In that case the multipolygon
 *      geometry is inconsistent (as rings must not overlap). This inconsistency is healed by
 *      computing the 'union' of the two overlapping rings as a new ring. This union is
 *      guaranteed to have an area bigger than any of the two original rings, and is guaranteed
 *      to still be a ring (if the overlap is at least of dimension 1, i.e. a line or an area),
 *      and is guaranteed to still be directly contained in the parent node. Thus, the two
 *      original rings are discarded, and the new one is added to the hierarchy at the current
 *      level *instead* of the overlapping one that was present before.
 *    - be completely contained inside another ring at that level. In that case it is inserted
 *      recursively as a child to that ring.
