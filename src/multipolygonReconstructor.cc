/* The high-level algorithm to create multipolygons from a multipolygon relation is as follows:
 *     1. ignore all non-way members
 *     2. build geometric rings (node sequences that start and end with the same node) by connecting ways
 *     3. from all rings build a geometric "contains" hierarchy (each ring becomes the child node to that
 *       ring which directly contains it)
 *     4. from the "contains" hierarchy, assign inner/outer roles to form the multipolygon (not yet implemented)
 *     5. import tags from outer ways if necessary (not yet implemented)
 *
 *  Details:
 *  ========
 *
 *  2. Building Geometric Rings:
 *  ------------------
 *  Basic idea: Repeatedly find ways that share at least one endpoint, and connect those ways until none are left. 
 *              Then, discard any connected ways that do not start and end at the same point. Those are not closed
 *              and thus represent invalid parts of a multipolygon geometry. The remaining ways are the rings.
 *
 *  Implementation details:
 *  - In order to connect two ways, one way may need to be reversed to fit. In extreme cases, ways have to be reversed
 *    for each connecting of two ways. This could potentially impact performance negatively. 
 *    This implementation instead
 *    first creates an abstract RingSegment representation for each way, containing only its two end points, a 
 *    reference to the wayId, and a boolean 'reversed' flag storing whether a way needs to be reversed before connecting
 *    it (but without actually performing the reversion). The finding and 'connecting' of ways is then performed only
 *    on the RingSegments: Whenever two RingSegments should be connected, a new RingSegment is created that contains both
 *    original segments as its child, and contains the open end points of its children (i.e. those that are not connected
 *    to each other). The 'reversed' flag of the children is set accordingly. From that point on, the two original
 *    RingSegments are no longer considered for connection to other segments, but only the newly created one is. 
 *    This effectively creates a binary tree of RingSegments for each ring, where the end points of the top-most 
 *    RingSegment are identical (if the hierarchy indeed represents a closed ring).
 *    Once built, this hierarchy is then flattened into the actual ring by traversing it in-order, and adding the
 *    nodes of all ways referenced by traversed RingSegments to the output (along with the list of wayIds for
 *    later algorithms that might need that list). In this process, each way is reversed *at most once*.
 *
 *  - Finding pairs of ways that can be connected would be ineffective if implemented naively (testing each way against
 *    every other way). Instead, we use a dictionary to map open (i.e. unconnected) endpoints to the corresponding
 *    RingSegment and test for connectable RingSegments by checking whether a way's endpoint is present in 
 *    that dictionary.
 *    In detail, the dictionary is initially empty, and RingSegments are added to it incrementally: Each RingSegment is only
 *    added to the dictionary, if none of its endpoints are already in there. Otherwise, the RingSegment
 *    belonging to that endpoint is removed from the dictionary (i.e. both of its endpoints are removed), a new
 *    merged RingSegment is created covering the two segments, and only the new RingSegment is re-considered for 
 *    insertion into the dictionary. Any RingSegment that is closed in itself is never added to the dictionary, but
 *    is directly stored in a list of closed rings. If the set of all rings form a valid multipolygon, the list of open
 *    endpoints will be empty, as all rings have been closed. Otherwise (for invalid geometry), the set of open rings
 *    is discarded. 
 *    This approach should only need O(n log(n) ) time (adding at most O(n) RingSegments to the dictionary, with each
 *    insertion requiring O(log(n)) time) in the number of RingSegments, while the naive approach
 *    requires O(nÂ²) time (testing every way against every other way).
 *
 *
 *    3. Building the 'Contains' Hierarchy
 *    ====================================
 *    Multipolygons consist of 'outer' Rings, and 'holes' inside these Rings. In theory, all OSM multipolygon members 
 *    are correctly tagged with the corresponding 'outer' and 'inner' roles. In practice, however, role tagging can be
 *    wrong, inconsistent or missing, and the geometry itself may be inconsistent (e.g. an 'outer' ring overlapping
 *    with an 'inner' ring. Thus, to guarantee creation of valid multipolygons, role tagging must be ignored. Instead,
 *    geometric inconsistencies must be healed, and the correct roles be reconstructed geometrically.
 *    To that end, a 'contains' hierarchy of rings is created, where each ring can have any number of other rings as
 *    children, and a ring A is a direct parent of another ring B iff. A contains B and there is no other ring C which
 *    is contained in A and in turn contains B. From that hierarchy, the outer/inner roles can easily be determined:
 *    any ring on the top level is an 'outer' ring. Any ring on the next level is an 'inner' ring (a hole in an 'outer'
 *    ring). Then, the roles 'outer' and 'inner' alternate for each additional level (e.g. all rings on the third level
 *    are 'outer' rings, representing a polygon inside a hole of another polygon).
 *    
 *    To build this hierarchy efficiently, it is observed that a ring A can only contain another ring B, if the area
 *    of A is bigger than that of B. Thus, all rings are sorted by area in descending order, and are inserted 
 *    into the hierarchy one by one in that order. So, no ring can contain any ring inserted into the hierarchy before
 *    itself, and it is thus guaranteed that once inserted the position of a ring inside the hierarchy never has to
 *    change.
 *
 *    In detail, a ring is inserted into the hierarchy as follows. Each ring is inserted recursively, starting with
 *    the top level (the list of all top-level rings not contained in any other ring.): at each level the ring under 
 *    consideration may be:
 *    - not overlapping with any other ring at that level. In that case it is inserted into the hierarchy at that level.
 *    - overlap with another ring at that level (i.e. there is some geometry shared by both rings, and some geometry
 *      exclusive to either ring). In that case the multipolygon geometry is inconsistent (as rings must
 *      not overlap). This inconsistency is healed by computing the 'union' of the two overlapping rings as a new ring.
 *      This union is guaranteed to have an area bigger than any of the two original rings, is guaranteed to still be a
 *      ring (if the overlap is at least of dimension 1, i.e. a line or an area), and is guaranteed to still be directly
 *      contained in the parent node. Thus, the two original rings are 
 *      discarded, and the new one is added to the hierarchy at the current level *instead* of the overlapping one 
 *      that was present before.
 *    - be completely contained inside another ring at that level. In that case it is inserted recursively as a child
 *      to that ring.
